                <h1>About Andrew.</h1>
                <h3>
                    Born and raised in San Diego, California.<br>
                    Live and venture through Portland, Oregon.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The path I chose to take in my career led me to explore many disciplines and many walks of life. From childcare, research in sleep disorders, pediatric neurology and mitochondrial disease, providing behavior therapy, I made my way eventually to web and visual design.  These different stages of my life have one thing in common, and it is to make an impact on other people’s lives.
                    <br><br>
                    I impact people’s lives and help reach their goals through the services that I provide.  But after going through each stage of my career, I noticed that the majority of help I provide is limited to the people in my immediate radius.  What I want to do is provide a service that can reach hundreds if not thousands of people’s lives with what I do, and this is eventually what led me to visual and web design.
                    <br><br>
                    My empathy, which comes from the many years dedicated to problem solving and helping people, helps me understand hows others feel. This includes how frustrating it can be for people when interacting with technology.  There are tons of websites and applications out there, and some can be difficult to navigate. Accessibility is the factor that I provide in my designs, and it is what I want to showcase as a visual designer.  If you are in need of a website, prototype, logo, video or anything visual on the web, feel free to reach me.  I would be more than happy to help you!
