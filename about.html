                <h1>About Andrew.</h1>
                <h3>
                    Born and raised in San Diego, California.<br>
                    Live and venture through Portland, Oregon.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My entire career path has led me in different directions from childcare, several disciplines of research that include sleep disorders, pediatric neurology and mitochondrial disease, to behavior therapy and eventually to web and visual design.  These different stages of my life have one thing in common, and it is to make an impact on other people’s lives.
                    <br><br>
                    I was able to make direct impacts on people lives by providing services that has helped them reach different life goals.  But after going through each stage of my career, I noticed that the majority of help I provide is limited to the people I can physically see.  What I want to do is provide a service that can reach hundreds if not thousands of people’s lives with what I do, and this is eventually what led me to visual and web design.
                    <br><br>
                    My empathy for others made me realize how frustrating it can be for people with disabilities that interact with technology, especially with web applications or websites.  There are tons of websites out there, and there are some that can be clustered with either overwhelming or underwhelming content, making it often times hard to navigate around the site. Accessibility is the factor that I provide in my designs, and it is what I want to showcase as a visual designer.  If you are in need of a website, prototype, logo, video or anything visual on the web, feel free to reach me.  I would be more than welcome to help you!
